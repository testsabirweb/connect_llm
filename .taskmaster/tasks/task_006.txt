# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement hybrid search API endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2 (Not found), 5 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Create RESTful API for hybrid search functionality combining semantic vector search and keyword search
# Details:
Build Golang API server with endpoints for search queries, document retrieval, and metadata filtering. Implement hybrid search that combines vector similarity search with keyword/BM25 search for improved accuracy. Add search result fusion strategies, relevance scoring, and configurable search modes (vector-only, keyword-only, hybrid). Implement caching layer for frequent queries.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with various queries, verify hybrid search relevance compared to individual search modes, test filters and pagination, perform load testing with concurrent users (target: 1000 RPS), measure search latency (target: <100ms p99)
