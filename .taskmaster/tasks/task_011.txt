# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add advanced search result ranking and filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6 (Not found)
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance hybrid search with advanced ranking algorithms and filters
# Details:
Build on top of hybrid search implementation to add advanced relevance scoring that combines vector similarity and keyword relevance scores. Add metadata-based filtering (source, date, author, channel), create faceted search capabilities, implement result re-ranking based on user interaction data. Optimize query performance with result caching and query planning.

# Test Strategy:
Test ranking accuracy with A/B testing, verify filter combinations work with both vector and keyword search, measure query performance under load, validate faceted search counts
