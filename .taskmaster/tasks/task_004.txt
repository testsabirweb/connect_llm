# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build document processing pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Create pipeline for chunking documents and generating embeddings
# Details:
Implement document chunking algorithm to split large messages into smaller segments. Integrate with embedding generation service (initially can use Ollama or a lightweight model).

# Test Strategy:
Test chunking with various document sizes, verify embedding generation, measure processing performance
