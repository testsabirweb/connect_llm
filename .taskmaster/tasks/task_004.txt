# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build document processing pipeline with error handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Create pipeline for chunking documents and generating embeddings with robust error handling and retry mechanisms
# Details:
Implement document chunking algorithm to split large messages into smaller segments. Integrate with embedding generation service (initially can use Ollama or a lightweight model). Include comprehensive error handling for failed embeddings, retry logic with exponential backoff, and ability to resume processing from failures. Track and log failed documents for manual review.

# Test Strategy:
Test chunking with various document sizes, verify embedding generation, measure processing performance, test error scenarios and retry mechanisms, validate resume functionality
