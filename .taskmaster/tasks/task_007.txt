# Task ID: 7
# Title: Set up Ollama integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Ollama with llama3:8b model for chat functionality as part of Docker Compose setup
# Details:
Configure Ollama service in Docker Compose with proper GPU support (if available) or CPU fallback. Pull llama3:8b model during container initialization, and create Go client for API interactions. Configure model parameters for optimal performance. Ensure proper networking between Ollama container and API server within Docker network.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Ollama is running within Docker Compose network, test model inference from API container, measure response times, validate GPU usage if available
