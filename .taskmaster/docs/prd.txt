# Overview
ConnectLLM is an internal knowledge search and discovery platform that provides intelligent, unified access to company data across various sources. Similar to Glean, it enables employees to instantly find information scattered across internal systems through semantic search and conversational AI. The platform starts with CSV data ingestion and will expand to real-time connectors for Slack, Jira, GitHub, and Google Workspace.

The solution addresses the critical problem of information silos in organizations where valuable knowledge is trapped in disconnected systems, causing employees to waste hours searching for information, duplicating work, or making decisions without full context.

# Core Features

## Semantic Search Engine
- **What it does**: Provides intelligent search across all indexed company data using vector embeddings and natural language understanding
- **Why it's important**: Enables employees to find information using natural language queries rather than exact keyword matches
- **How it works**: Leverages Weaviate vector database to store and query document embeddings, with relevance ranking based on semantic similarity

## Conversational AI Assistant
- **What it does**: Offers a chatbot interface powered by Ollama's llama3:8b model for interactive Q&A
- **Why it's important**: Allows users to ask follow-up questions, get summaries, and extract insights from search results
- **How it works**: Integrates search results with LLM context to provide intelligent responses

## Multi-Source Data Ingestion
- **What it does**: Ingests and indexes data from CSV files (initial) and future connectors
- **Why it's important**: Creates a unified knowledge base from disparate data sources
- **How it works**: Processes various data formats, extracts metadata, and generates embeddings for vector search

## Permission-Aware Results
- **What it does**: Respects source system permissions and only shows results users have access to
- **Why it's important**: Maintains security and compliance while enabling broad search capabilities
- **How it works**: Stores and checks access control metadata alongside indexed content

# User Experience
