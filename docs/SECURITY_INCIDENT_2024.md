# Security Incident Report: API Key Exposure

## Incident Summary

**Date**: December 2024
**Type**: Accidental API Key Exposure
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved

## What Happened

An OpenRouter API key was accidentally committed and pushed to the GitHub repository in the following files:

- `TASKMASTER_GUIDE.md`
- `API_SETUP.md`

## Impact

- The exposed API key could have been used by unauthorized parties
- The key had access to OpenRouter's API services
- No evidence of misuse was found, but the key was potentially exposed to public view

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Immediate Key Revocation**
   - The compromised API key should be immediately revoked in the OpenRouter dashboard
   - A new API key should be generated

2. **Git History Cleanup**
   - Used `git filter-branch` to remove the files containing API keys from the entire Git history
   - Force pushed the cleaned history to GitHub

3. **File Recreation**
   - Recreated both documentation files with placeholder text instead of actual API keys
   - Committed and pushed the cleaned versions

4. **Security Measures**
   - Verified `.gitignore` already includes:
     - `.env` files
     - `.cursor/mcp.json`
   - These rules prevent future accidental commits of sensitive data

## Lessons Learned

1. Always use placeholder text in documentation files
2. Never include actual API keys in example code or documentation
3. Review files carefully before committing, especially documentation
4. Use git pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets

## Preventive Measures

1. **Use Environment Variables**: API keys should only exist in:
   - `.env` files (for CLI usage)
   - `.cursor/mcp.json` (for MCP/Cursor integration)
   - Both are already in `.gitignore`

2. **Documentation Best Practices**:
   - Always use placeholders like `your-api-key-here`
   - Never copy actual keys into documentation

3. **Consider Additional Tools**:
   - GitHub secret scanning
   - Pre-commit hooks for secret detection (already configured)
   - Regular security audits

## Action Items

- [ ] Revoke the exposed API key immediately
- [ ] Generate and configure a new OpenRouter API key
- [ ] Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with the new key
- [ ] Update `.env` file (if using CLI) with the new key
- [ ] Verify all services are working with the new key
